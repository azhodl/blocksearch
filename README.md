# blocksearch
This is my my first python class final project. Its accuracy is limited until I am able to parse through the entire bitcoin blockchain to build a full library. Currenlty this 
library is limited to every 10,000 blocks so accuracy is within a month of your birthday. Will update as my technical ability increases.

This program represents a personal desire to provide all my children and friends/family a phsical bitcoin wallet that is customized to their birthday.
To exexcuting main.py with input.py and blocks.py in the same directory. Once the program executes it will print the results to Wallet.txt. 

I look to continue building this program to include the ability to enter an address of you bitcoin wallet to include a QR code in the output and include the nearest 
block message or a message of your choosing such as the genesis block. Ultimately this will be physical completed with a 3D printer to buid a physical coin or card
for the output. 

Please feel free to comment or contribute to this development.
