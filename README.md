# blocksearch
This is my my first python class final project. Its accuracy is limited until I am able to parse through the entire bitcoin blockchain to build a full library. Currenlty this 
library is limited to every 10,000 blocks so accuracy is within a month of your birthday. Will update as my technical ability increases.

To exexcute: 
Run main.py with input.py and blocks.py in the same directory. 
Follow the prompts which completes by writing your wallet to Wallet.txt. 

This program represents a personal desire to provide all my children and friends/family a phsical bitcoin wallet that is customized to their birthday.

I look to continue building this program to include the ability to enter an address of you bitcoin wallet to include a QR code in the output and include the nearest 
block message or a message of your choosing such as the genesis block. Ultimately this will be physical completed with a 3D printer to buid a physical coin or card
for the output. 

Please feel free to comment or contribute to this development. I will implement a web version at AZHODL.com in the near future.
